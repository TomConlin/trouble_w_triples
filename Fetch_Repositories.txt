#BOLD
BarCode of Life records will be found at <http://www.barcodinglife.com/index.php/Public_SearchTerms> by searching for "Chordata" (the dataset I used in 2013-14 was around 20M gzipped but 122M to dl)


```
curl "http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/API_Public/specimen?taxon=Chordata&format=tsv" > BOLD_Chordata_`datestamp`.tsv
```

#GenBank
GenBank records will be found by FTP-ing the divisions related to vertabrates (around 6.3G gzipped)
```
for div in pri rod mam vrt ; do
        wget ftp://bio-mirror.net/biomirror/genbank/gb${div}*.seq.gz
done
```

#VertNet

VertNet records come in Darwin Core Archive datasets so there will be over a hundred files to fetch

I first got to the archives by scraping and transforming links found on 
<http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/>  with something named "fetch_VertNet_IPT.sh" 

However I have since learned of <https://vertnet.cartodb.com/tables/resource/public>
which also has links to to VertNet datasets not hosted at VertNet.

```
curl -s "http://vertnet.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT+dwca+FROM+resource" | jq ".rows[]|[.dwca]|@sh"
```

will give you the list of URLs to fetch but I will leave it up to you to choose how 
note: my generating this list used "jq" <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>

took about an hour (serially) and produced 19G of uncompressed files.
